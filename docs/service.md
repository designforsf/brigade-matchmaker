# Project Match: Service Description

Project Match is a service for new members. Many pieces and stakeholders come together to make this possible.

## Project content

Local civic projects are asked to maintain data about their volunteer needs in terms of skills needed, learning offered, and goals. Other information is also tracked about projects to form a profile, including what interest category they belong to.

## Project match form

When a new member arrives, he/she is asked to open a URL and begins the matching process. The new member is asked to select from three sets of keywords:

* **Skills to offer:** server-side python, machine learning, legal, etc.
* **Skills to learn:** client-side javascript, civic organizing, etc.
* **Civic interests:**  elections, homelessness, housing, infrastructure, etc.

## Project match

A matching algorithm is employed to generate a sorted list of projects. This algorithm uses the civic interests, skills, and learning opportunities entered by the new member to score every project based on keyword matching. 

Based on what was entered in the project match form, list of projects sorted by the matching scores is presented. 

## Project profile

There is brief information describing each project and how it fits what he/she is looking for. Within this list, the new member is then able to select projects that interest them and send messages to project leaders. 

## Messaging

A user can message the project leads. This is mediated using a common email account, enabling messages to me passed back and forth without revealing the new member's email address.

## Bookmarks

A user can bookmark projects that interest him/her. This is retained in the browser temporarily, until the user chooses to create an account with their email address.
